            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>A <strong>baked potato</strong>, known in some parts of the United Kingdom (though not generally Scotland) as a <strong>jacket potato</strong>, 
            is a preparation of potato. The ideal baked potato has a fluffy interior and a crispy skin. It may be served with fillings, toppings or condiments
            such as butter, cheese, sour cream, gravy, baked beans, and even ground meat or corned beef.</p>
            <p>Some varieties of potato, such as Russet and King Edward, are more suitable for baking than others, owing to their size and consistency. Despite
            the popular misconception that potatoes are fattening, baked potatoes can be part of a healthy diet.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 medium russet potatoes</li>
                <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>Sea salt</li>
                <li>Cashew Sour Cream</li>
                <li>Tempeh Bacon Bits</li>
                <li>Chives</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Position an oven rack in the top third of the oven and preheat to 190Â°C. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange the Bacon
                    slices in a single layer on top. Bake until the bacon is golden brown and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes, flipping once halfway through.
                    Transfer the bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate to absorb any excess fat and let cool. Crumble cooled bacon.</li>
                <li>Discard  the parchment and pour off the remaining excess bacon drippings from the baking sheet, leaving only a thin coating of fat on the baking sheet.
                    Reserve the poured-off drippings. Increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Toss the fingerling potatoes with 2 tablespoons of the reserved bacon drippings, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Place the potatoes
                    cut-side-down on the baking sheet in a crowded single layer. Bake until the potatoes just start to brown, 15 minutes, then flip and continue to bake
                    until cooked through, golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Remove the potatoes from the oven and place the baking sheet on a heat-safe surface. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to push the potatoes together so 
                    that they are all touching but remain in a single layer. Sprinkle the potatoes with the cheese and bacon, return to the oven and bake until the cheese is 
                    melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer the potatoes to a platter with a large spatula. Top with dollops of sour cream and the spring onions. Finish by squeezing the lemon over the top.
                    Serve hot.</li>
            </ol>
