                    <h3>Description</h3>

                    <p><strong>Spaghetti</strong> is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine.
                    Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals.
                    Italien spaghetti is typically made from durum wheat semolina. Usually the pasta is white because refined flour may be added.
                    Spaghettoni is a thicker form of spaghetti, while capellini is a very thin spaghetti.</p>
                    <p>Originally, spaghetti was notably long, but shorter lenghts gained in popularity during the latter half of the 20th century
                    and now it is most commonly available in 25-30 cm (10-12 in) lenghts. A variety of pasta
                    dishes are based on it and it is frequently served with tomato sauce or meat or vegetables.</p>
